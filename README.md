# DETR_Segmentation

### Requirement

Collect the dataset

Train DETR on this dataset!

You need to document your training process, and link separate (properly named) notebooks in the readme file along with notes for me to understand how you have trained your model. 

Your training logs MUST be available for review.

You need to document your training process, and link separate (properly named) notebooks in the readme file along with notes for me to understand how you have trained your model. 

Your training logs MUST be available for review.  

Linking the model end to end is not the objective. The objective is to solve the problem end to end. You MUST have trained for over 500 EPOCHS in total (for all the models combined) and show that your loss is reduced substantially from the starting point.

You need to split your dataset into 80/20 and then show the test accuracy in the readme file.

Missing the first 2 submissions by the 20th day will disqualify you from the CAPSTONE project.

You must show the results on 100 randomly picked samples from the test dataset and show the results in the following 3 parallel images:
First Image: Orignal Image
Second: Ground Truth
Third: Predicted Segmentation Map
