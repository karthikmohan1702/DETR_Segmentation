# DETR_Segmentation

### Requirement



------------------------------


Since ViT (an image is worth 16x16 words) works very effective in object classification as compared to CNN methods in virtue of computer vision. But to achieve an object detection, segmentation, panoptic segmentation, object localization, object colorization, we need the help of convolutions to achieve. So Detr or Detection transformers was developed by Facebook Team.


In DeTR generation of the embeddings is carried out by using convolutions, here they have used Resnet50 architecture as the backbone of the model.
